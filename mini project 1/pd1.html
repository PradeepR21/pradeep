        <div class="flex para-section">
            <div>The most damning indictment of Royal Challengers Bengaluru's floundering IPL 2024 season so far is that they are comfortably bottom in most key bowling metrics: average (43.60), strike-rate (26.4) and sixes conceded (65). They've also taken the least wickets - 25 - a number they share with their next opponents, Sunrisers Hyderabad, who have played one game fewer.

                But, while RCB are mired in wooden spoon trouble, SRH find themselves in the happy half of the points table. This is largely down to them living up to the modern T20 axiom of teams needing to maximise batting resources. After four target-setting scores in the range between 173 and 196 all ended in defeats, it is what RCB captain Faf du Plessis wants his side to do.
                
                "We have to push for that 200. We don't have as many weapons in our bowling. So it comes down to the batting. From a bowling perspective, we have lacked penetration. We have to get them two or three down in the powerplay. Always feels like we are on the back foot after the first four overs," the RCB captain lamented after the crushing loss in Mumbai.
                
                Flights back home after such chastening trips usually bring relief. For nothing is as comforting as well-known and well-made formula. Except this formula at the Chinnaswamy Stadium will also be hand delivered to the away dressing room - where the holders of the record IPL score will sit - with a hospitable 'all-you-can-eat' label.
                
                With the half-way stage in the league still approaching, chaos has been the overarching theme of RCB's campaign. They've used 19 players so far, benched their two most expensive pre-season signings - Cam Green and Alzarri Joseph - and are no closer to shrugging off the inertia. But after a groggy beginning that's already left them flat on the face, the only way ahead is up.</div>
            <div>9.25pm Like SRH did with Abhishek in the first innings, RCB have opted to open the bowling with Will Jacks. With two lefties in the fray, will this work?</div>
        </div>
        <div>9.21pm : So, in case any of you are wondering what are the chances for RCB to still make it to the playoff, it's all been laid out here. Meanwhile, Faf du Plessis gives his team a final team talk before they go out. And the moustachioed Travis Head and baby-faced Abhishek Sharma stride out with the confidence of two men who have instilled fear in opposition bowlers. T Natarajan goes out for Head, who comes in as the Impact Player.</div>
